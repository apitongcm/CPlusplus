## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apitongcm/CPlusplus.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPlusplus

3. Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file_name source_file.cpp

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file_name

## Usage
You can explore the various C++ files in this repository to see examples of different concepts. Each file contains comments explaining the code and its functionality.
